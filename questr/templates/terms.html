		<b>How the Site, Application and Services Work</b>
		<p>The Site, Application and Services can be used to facilitate the requesting, applying, and shipping of Deliveries. Such Deliveries are included in Requests on the Site, Application and Services by Requesters. Only Shippers may view Requests via the Site, Application and Services; therefore, if you wish to request a Delivery, you must first register to create an Questr Account (defined below), and if you wish to apply for and transport a Delivery, you mush become a Shipper.</p>

Questr is not an owner or operator of packages or delivery, including, but not limited to, boxes, contents in the boxes, or means of transportation to deliver packages, nor is it a provider of packages or delivery, including, but not limited to, boxes, contents in the boxes, or means of transportation to deliver packages and Questr does not own, sell, resell, provide, rent, re-rent, manage, control, and/or guarantee the safety and legality of packages or delivery, including, but not limited to, boxes, contents in the boxes, or means of transportation to deliver packages. Unless explicitly specified otherwise in the Questr platform, Questr’s responsibilities are limited to: (i) facilitating the availability of the Site, Application and Services and (ii) serving as the limited payment collection agent of each Requester for the purpose of accepting payments from Shippers on behalf of the Requester.</p>
		<p>PLEASE NOTE THAT, AS STATED ABOVE, THE SITE, APPLICATION AND SERVICES ARE INTENDED TO BE USED TO FACILITATE REQUESTERS AND SHIPPERS CONNECTING AND SHIPPING DELIVERIES DIRECTLY WITH EACH OTHER. QUESTR CANNOT AND DOES NOT CONTROL THE CONTENT CONTAINED IN ANY REQUESTS AND THE CONDITION, LEGALITY OR SUITABILITY OF ANY DELIVERIES. QUESTR IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR AND DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL LIABILITY RELATED TO ANY AND ALL REQUESTS AND DELIVERIES. ACCORDINGLY, ANY SHIPPINGS WILL BE MADE AT THE SHIPPER’S OWN RISK.</p>
		<b>Account Registration</b>
		<p>In order to access certain features of the Site and Application, and to request a Delivery or apply for a Request, you must register to create an account (“<b>Questr Account</b>”) and become a Member. You may register to join the Services directly via the Site or Application or as described in this section.</p>
		<p>You can also register to join by logging into your account with certain third-party social networking sites (“<b>SNS</b>”) (including, but not limited to, Facebook; each such account, a “<b>Third-Party Account</b>”), via our Site or Application, as described below. As part of the functionality of the Site, Application and Services, you may link your Questr Account with Third-Party Accounts, by either: (i) providing your Third-Party Account login information to Questr through the Site, Services or Application; or (ii) allowing Questr to access your Third-Party Account, as permitted under the applicable terms and conditions that govern your use of each Third-Party Account. You represent that you are entitled to disclose your Third-Party Account login information to Questr and/or grant Questr access to your Third-Party Account (including, but not limited to, for use for the purposes described herein), without breach by you of any of the terms and conditions that govern your use of the applicable Third-Party Account and without obligating Questr to pay any fees or making Questr subject to any usage limitations imposed by such third-party service providers. By granting Questr access to any Third-Party Accounts, you understand that Questr will access, make available and store (if applicable) any Content that you have provided to and stored in your Third-Party Account (“<b>SNS Content</b>”) so that it is available on and through the Site, Services and Application via your Questr Account and Questr Account profile page. Unless otherwise specified in these Terms, all SNS Content, if any, will be considered to be Member Content for all purposes of these Terms. Depending on the Third-Party Accounts you choose and subject to the privacy settings that you have set in such Third-Party Accounts, personally identifiable information that you post to your Third-Party Accounts will be available on and through your Questr Account on the Site, Services and Application. Please note that if a Third-Party Account or associated service becomes unavailable or Questr’s access to such Third-Party Account is terminated by the third-party service provider, then SNS Content will no longer be available on and through the Site, Services and Application. You have the ability to disable the connection between your Questr Account and your Third-Party Accounts, at any time, by accessing the “Settings” section of the Site and Application. PLEASE NOTE THAT YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR THIRD-PARTY ACCOUNTS IS GOVERNED SOLELY BY YOUR AGREEMENT(S) WITH SUCH THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS. Questr makes no effort to review any SNS Content for any purpose, including but not limited to for accuracy, legality or non-infringement and Questr is not responsible for any SNS Content.</p>
		<p>We will create your Questr Account and your Questr Account profile page for your use of the Site and Application based upon the personal information you provide to us or that we obtain via an SNS as described above. You may not have more than one (1) active Questr Account. You agree to provide accurate, current and complete information during the registration process and to update such information to keep it accurate, current and complete. Questr reserves the right to suspend or terminate your Questr Account and your access to the Site, Application and Services if you create more than one (1) Questr Account or if any information provided during the registration process or thereafter proves to be inaccurate, not current or incomplete. You are responsible for safeguarding your password. You agree that you will not disclose your password to any third party and that you will take sole responsibility for any activities or actions under your Questr Account, whether or not you have authorized such activities or actions. You will immediately notify Questr of any unauthorized use of your Questr Account.</p>
		<b>Delivery Requests</b>
		<p>As a Member, you may create Requests. To apply for a Request, you will be asked a variety of questions about the Delivery to be requested, including, but not limited to, the size, appearance, addresses of pick-up and drop-off locations, and title of the Delivery and then the Site, Application and Services will provide you with a price that is determined by certain attributes including, but not limited to, current local time of where the request was submitted. Requests will be made exclusively available to the Shippers and the Site, Application and Services via the Site, Application and Services. Shippers will be able to apply for your Delivery via the Site, Application and Services based upon the information provided in your Request. You understand and agree that once a Shipper requests an acceptance of your Delivery, you may not request the Shipper to pay a higher price than in the request.</p>
		<p>You acknowledge and agree that you are responsible for any and all Requests you post. Accordingly, you represent and warrant that any Request you post and the shipping of, or a Shipper's application for, a Delivery in a Request you post (i) will not breach any agreements you have entered into with any third parties, and (ii) will (a) be in compliance with all applicable laws (such as laws governing possession of illegally goods, and laws governing shipments of potentially hazardous goods), Tax requirements, and rules and regulations that may apply to any Delivery included in a Request you post (including having all required permits, licenses and registrations), and (b) not conflict with the rights of third parties. Please note that Questr assumes no responsibility for a Requester’s compliance with any agreements with or duties to third parties, applicable laws, rules and regulations. Questr reserves the right, at any time and without prior notice, to permanently terminate a Requester’s Account, to put such Requester on blacklist, and to remove or disable access to any Request for any reason, including Requests that Questr, in its sole discretion, considers to be objectionable for any reason, in violation of these Terms or Questr’s then-current Policies and Community Guidelines (at <a href="http://www.questr.co/help/policies">http://www.questr.co/help/policies</a>), or otherwise harmful to the Site, Application or Services.</p>
		<p>If you are a Requester, you understand and agree that Questr does not act as an insurer or as your contracting agent. If a Shipper requests an acceptance of your Delivery and ships your Delivery, any agreement you enter into with such Shipper is between you and the Shipper and Questr is not a party thereto.</p>
		<p>When you apply for a Request, you may also choose to include certain requirements which must be met by the Members who are eligible to request an acceptance of your Delivery, including, but not limited to, requiring Members to have a profile picture or verified phone number, in order to request your Delivery. Any Member wishing to request Deliveries included in Requests with such requirements must meet these requirements.</p>
		<b>No Endorsement</b>
		<p>Questr does not endorse any Member or any Delivery. Any references in the Site, Application or Services to a Member being “verified” or “connected” (or similar language) only indicate that the Member has completed a relevant verification process, and does not represent anything else. Any such description is not an endorsement, certification or guarantee by Questr about any Member, including of the Member’s identity and whether the Member is trustworthy, safe or suitable. Instead, any such description is intended to be useful information for you to evaluate when you make your own decisions about the identity and suitability of others whom you contact or interact with via the Site, Application and Services. We therefore recommend that you always exercise due diligence and care when deciding whether to ship your Delivery with a Requester or to accept an acceptance request from a Shipper, or to have any other interaction with any other Member. We are not responsible for any damage or harm resulting from your interactions with other Members.</p>
		<p>By using the Site, Application or Services, you agree that any legal remedy or liability that you seek to obtain for actions or omissions of other Members or other third parties will be limited to a claim against the particular Members or other third parties who caused you harm. You agree not to attempt to impose liability on or seek any legal remedy from Questr with respect to such actions or omissions. Accordingly, we encourage you to communicate directly with other Members on the Site and Services regarding any Deliveries or Requests made by you. This limitation shall not apply to any claim by a Requester against Questr regarding the remittance of payments received from a Shipper by Questr on behalf of a Requester, which instead shall be subject to the limitations described in the section below entitled “Limitation of Liability”.</p>
		<b>Bookings and Financial Terms</b>
		<br><i>Key definitions</i>
		<p>
			“<b>Delivery Fees</b>” means the amounts that are due and payable by a Shipper in exchange for that Shipper’s shipment of a Delivery. A pricing model that was developed by Questr, and not Questr, determines these amounts automatically. 
			<br>
			 “<b>Service Fees</b>” means the fee that Questr charges a Shipper for the use of its online platform, which is calculated as a percentage of the applicable Delivery Fees or a fixed amount if the Delivery Fee is under a certain amount. The Service Fees will be displayed to the Shipper when the Shipper is asked whether to send an acceptance request to a Requester.  
			<br>
			“<b>Total Fees</b>” means collectively the Delivery Fees and the Service Fees (plus any Taxes in respect of Service Fees, such as HST in Ontario, Canada).
		</p>
		<i>Requests, Deliveries, and Financial Terms, Part One</i>
		<p>If you are a Requester and an acceptance is requested for your Delivery via the Site, Application and Services, you will be required to either confirm or reject the acceptance request within the Delivery Request Period, otherwise the acceptance request will be automatically cancelled. When an acceptance is requested via the Site, Application and Services, we will share with you (i) the first and last name of the Shipper who has requested the acceptance, (ii) a link to the Shipper’s Questr Account profile page, so that you can view such information before confirming or rejecting the acceptance request. If you are unable to confirm or decide to reject an acceptance request within the Delivery Request Period, any amounts collected by Questr for the requested Delivery will be refunded to your applicable credit card and any pre-authorization of such credit card will be released. When you confirm an acceptance requested by a Shipper, Questr will send you an email, text message or message via the Application confirming the Delivery, depending on the selections you make via the Site, Application and Services.</p>
		<p>Questr will collect the Total Fees at the time of acceptance confirmation (i.e. when the Requester confirms the acceptance request) and will initiate payment of the Delivery Fees (less any Taxes in respect of the Requester Fees, such as HST in Ontario, Canada) from the Requester when the Shipper picks up the applicable Delivery (except to the extent that a refund is due to the Shipper). The time it takes for the Shipper to receive payouts may depend upon the method for receiving payouts chosen by the Requester. Some methods involve the use of third-party payment processors, who may impose their own additional charges for the use of their services on the Requester, including by deducting their charges from the payout amount.</p>
		<p>If you owe or agree to pay any amount to Questr (whether as a result of your requests or shipments as a Shipper or otherwise), then Questr may (but is not obliged to) withhold the amount owing to Questr from any payout amounts due to you as a Shipper or a Requester, and use the withheld amount to setoff the amount owed by you to Questr. If Questr does so, then your obligation to pay Questr will be extinguished to the extent of the amount withheld by Questr, and Questr will cease to owe to you any obligations (including, but not limited to, any obligation to pay you) with respect to the amount withheld.</p>
		<i>Appointment of Questr as Limited Payment Collection Agent for Requester</i>
		<p>Each Shipper hereby appoints Questr as the Requester’s limited payment collection agent solely for the purpose of accepting the Delivery Fees from Requester.</p>
		<p>Each Shipper agrees that payment made by a Requester through Questr, shall be considered the same as a payment made directly to the Shipper, and the Shipper will make the Delivery successful to the Requester in the agreed-upon manner as if the Shipper has received the Delivery Fees. Each Shipper agrees that Questr may, in accordance with the cancellation policy selected by the Shipper and reflected in the relevant Request, (i) permit the Requester to cancel the Delivery and (ii) refund (via Questr) to the Requester that portion of the Delivery Fees specified in the applicable cancellation policy. Each Requester understands that as Questr accepts payments from Requester as the Shipper limited payment collection agent and that Questr’ obligation to pay the Shipper is subject to and conditional upon successful receipt of the associated payments from Requester. Questr does not guarantee payments to Shipper for amounts that have not been successfully received by Questr from Requester. In accepting appointment as the limited authorized agent of the Shipper, Questr assumes no liability for any acts or omissions of the Shipper.</p>
		<p>Please note that Questr does not currently charge fees for the creation of Requests. However, you as a Requester acknowledge and agree that Questr reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to charge you for and collect fees from you for the creation of Requests. Please note that Questr may or may not provide notice of any Request fee collection via the Site, Application and Services, prior to implementing such a Request fee feature.</p>
		<i>Requests, Deliveries, and Financial Terms, Part Two</i>
		<p>The Shipper, not Questr, are solely responsible for honouring any confirmed Deliveries and delivering any Deliveries reserved through the Site, Application and Services. If you, as a Shipper, choose to enter into a transaction with a Requester for the shipment of a Delivery, you agree and understand that you will be required to enter into an agreement with the Requester and you agree to accept any contents, terms, conditions, rules and restrictions associated with such Delivery imposed by the Requester. You acknowledge and agree that you, and not Questr, will be responsible for performing the obligations of any such agreements, that Questr is not a party to such agreements, and that, with the exception of its payment obligations hereunder, Questr disclaims all liability arising from or related to any such agreements. You acknowledge and agree that, notwithstanding the fact that Questr is not a party to the agreement between you and the Requester, Questr acts as the Shipper’s payment collection agent for the limited purpose of accepting payments to you on behalf of the Requester. Upon the Requester’s payment of the Total Fees to Questr, your payment obligation to the Requester for the Delivery Fees is extinguished, and Questr is responsible for remitting the Delivery Fees (less any Taxes in respect of the Requester Fees, such as HST in Ontario, Canada), in the manner described in these Terms. In the event that Questr does not remit any such amounts as described in these Terms, such Requester will have recourse only against such Questr entity.</p>
		<p>The Total Fees payable will be displayed to a Requester before the Requester submits the Delivery on Questr. As noted above, the Requester is required to either confirm or reject the acceptance request within the Delivery Request Period, otherwise the requested Delivery will be automatically cancelled. If a requested Delivery is cancelled (i.e. not confirmed by the applicable Requester), any amounts collected by Questr will be refunded to such Requester, depending on the selections the Requester makes via the Site and Application, and any pre-authorization of such Shipper’s credit card will be released, if applicable.</p>
		<p>You as a Requester agree to pay Questr for the Total Fees for any Delivery requested in connection with your Questr Account if such requested Deliveries are confirmed by the applicable Shipper. In order to establish an acceptance pending the applicable Shipper’s confirmation of your requested Delivery, you understand and agree that Questr, on behalf of the Shipper, reserve the right, in its sole discretion, to (i) obtain a pre-authorization via your credit card for the Total Fees or (ii) charge your credit card a nominal amount, not to exceed one dollar ($1), or a similar sum in the currency in which you are transacting (e.g. one euro or one British pound), to verify your credit card. Once Questr receives confirmation of your Delivery from the applicable Requester, Questr will collect the Total Fees in accordance with these Terms and the pricing terms set forth in the applicable Request. Please note that Questr cannot control any fees that may be charged to a Requester by his or her bank related to Questr’s collection of the Total Fees, and Questr disclaims all liability in this regard.</p>
		<p>In connection with your requested Delivery, you will be asked to provide customary billing information such as name, billing address and credit card information either to Questr or its third-party payment processor(s). You agree to pay Questr for any confirmed bookings made in connection with your Questr Account in accordance with these Terms by one of the methods described on the Site or Application, e.g. by PayPal or credit card. You hereby authorize the collection of such amounts by charging the credit card provided as part of requesting the booking, either directly by Questr or indirectly, via a third-party online payment processor or by one of the payment methods described on the Site or Application. You also authorize Questr to charge your credit card in the event of damage caused at a Delivery as contemplated under “Damage to Deliveries” below and for Security Deposits, if applicable. If you are directed to Questr’ third-party payment processor(s), you may be subject to terms and conditions governing use of that third party’s service and that third party’s personal information collection practices. Please review such terms and conditions and privacy policy before using the services. Once your confirmed booking transaction is complete you will receive a confirmation email summarizing your confirmed booking.</p>
		<b>Service Fees</b>
		<p>In consideration for the use of Questr’s online marketplace and platform, Questr charges the Service Fees. Where applicable, Taxes (such as HST in Ontario, Canada) may also be charged in respect of the Delivery Fees and Service Fees. Questr deducts the Service Fees from the Delivery Fees before remitting the balance to the Shipper as described in these Terms.</p>
		<p>Balances will be remitted by Questr to Shipper via check, PayPal, direct deposit or other payment methods described on the Site or via the Application, in the Shipper currency of choice, depending upon the selections the Shipper makes via the Site, Application and Services. Amounts may be rounded up or down as described the “Rounding Off” section below.</p>
		<p>Please note that Questr, may impose or deduct foreign currency processing costs on or from any payments or payouts by Questr in currencies other than U.S. dollars. More information on any such costs or deductions will be available via the Site and Application. More information on any such costs or deductions will be available via the Site and Application. More information on Services Fees can be found at <a href="http://www.questr.co/help">www.questr.co/help</a>. Except as otherwise provided herein, Service Fees are non-refundable.</p>
		<b>General Requests, Deliveries, and Financial Terms</b>
		<p><i>Cancellations and Refunds</i></p>
		<p>If, as a Requester, you cancel your requested Delivery before the requested Delivery is confirmed by a Shipper, Questr will cancel any pre-authorization to your credit card and/or refund any nominal amounts charged to your credit card in connection with the requested Delivery within a commercially reasonable time. If, as a Requester, you wish to cancel a confirmed booking made via the Site, Application and Services, either prior to or after the Shipper picking up the contents of the Delivery, the cancellation policy of the Requester contained in the applicable Request will apply to such cancellation. Our ability to refund the Delivery Fees and other amounts charged to you will depend upon the terms of the applicable cancellation policy. Details regarding refunds and cancellation policies are available via the Site and Application. The Service Fee is non-refundable regardless of the cancellation policy.</p>
		<p>If a Shipper cancels a confirmed Delivery made via the Site, Services, and Application, Questr will refund the Total Fees for such Delivery to the applicable Requester within a commercially reasonable time of the cancellation. If the Requester requests an acceptance from one of the alternative Requests and the Shipper associated with such alternative Request confirms the Requester’s requested Delivery, then the Requester agrees to pay Questr the Total Fees relating to the confirmed booking for the Delivery in the alternative Request, in accordance with these Terms. If a Shipper cancelled a confirmed booking and you, as a Requester, have not received an email or other communication from Questr, please contact Questr at <a href="http://www.questr.co/help/contact_us">http://www.questr.co/help/contact_us.</a></p>
		<p>If, as a Shipper, you cancel a confirmed booking, Questr may apply penalties or consequences to you or your Delivery, including (i) publishing an automated review on your Delivery indicating that a Delivery was cancelled, (ii) permanently terminating your account and putting the account and its associated information on blacklist, or (iii) imposing a cancellation fee (to be withheld from your future payouts). You will be notified of the situations in which a cancellation fee applies before you decide to cancel.</p>
		<p>In certain circumstances, Questr may decide, in its sole discretion, that it is necessary or desirable to cancel a confirmed booking made via the Site, Application and Services. Questr may also determine, in its sole discretion, to refund to the Requester part or all of the amounts charged to the Requester in accordance with the Refund Policy at <a href="http://www.questr.co/terms/refund_policy">www.questr.co/terms/refund_policy</a>. You agree that Questr and the relevant Shipper or Requester will not have any liability for such cancellations or refunds.</p>
		<i>Rounding Off</i>
		<p>Questr may, in its sole discretion, round up or round down amounts that are payable from or to Shippers or Requesters to the nearest whole functional base unit in which the currency is denominated (e.g. to the nearest dollar, euro or other supported currency); for example, Questr will round up an amount of $101.50 to $102.00, and $101.49 to $101.00.</p>
		<p>Some currencies are denominated in large numbers. In those cases, Questr may determine the functional base unit in which those currencies are denominated to be 10, 100 or 1,000 of the currency; the corresponding examples for such currencies would be for Questr to round up an amount of 1,045 up to 1,050 and 1,044 down to 1,040, or 35,450 up to 35,500 and 35,449 down to 35,400, or 837,500 up to 838,000 and 837,499 down to 837,000.</p>
		<i>Payment Processing Errors</i>
		<p>We will take steps to rectify any payment processing errors that we become aware of. These steps may include crediting or debiting (as appropriate) the same payment method used for the original payout to or payment by you, so that you end up receiving or paying the correct amount.   Donations</p>
		<p>Some Shippers may pledge to donate a portion of the funds they receive from confirmed bookings made via the Site, Application and Services to a particular cause or charity. We do not take any responsibility or liability for whether the Shippers does in fact make the donation he or she pledged to make. In such cases, the Shippers in question is responsible for his or her own compliance with all laws and regulations applicable to such pledges and/or fund-raising.</p>
		<i>Taxes</i>
		<p>Tax regulations may require us to collect appropriate tax information from our Shippers or Requesters, or to withhold taxes from payouts to Shippers or Requesters, or both. You as a Shipper or Requester are solely responsible for keeping the information in your tax forms current, complete and accurate. If you as a Shipper or Requester fail to provide us with documentation that we determine to be sufficient to alleviate our obligation (if any) to withhold payments to you, we reserve the right in our sole discretion to freeze all payouts to you until resolution, to withhold such amounts as required by law, or to do both.</p>
		<p>You as a Shipper or Requester understand and agree that you are solely responsible for determining (i) your applicable Tax reporting requirements, and (ii) the Taxes that should be included, and for including Taxes to be collected or obligations relating to applicable Taxes in Requests and Deliveries. You are also solely responsible for remitting to the relevant authority any Taxes included or received by you. Questr cannot and does not offer Tax-related advice to any Members.</p>
		<p>Where applicable, or based upon request from a Shipper or Requester, Questr may issue a valid VAT invoice to such Shipper or Requester.</p>
		<p>You understand and acknowledge that appropriate governmental agencies, departments or authorities (the “<b>Tax Authority</b>”) where your shipments are done may require Taxes to be collected by Shippers from Requesters on the amount paid for the Deliveries, and to be remitted to the respective Tax Authority.</p>
		<p>Whether you are a Shipper of Requester, you agree that any claim or cause of action relating to collection and remittance of Taxes shall not extend to any supplier or vendor that may be used by Questr in connection with collection and remittance of any taxes, if any. Shippers and Requesters agree that we may seek additional amounts from you in the event that the Taxes collected or remitted are insufficient to fully discharge your obligations to the Tax Authority, and agree that your sole remedy for any taxes collected is a refund of any taxes collected by Questr from the applicable Tax Authority in accordance with applicable procedures set by that Tax Authority.</p>
		<i>Damage to the Contents of Deliveries</i>
		<p>As a Shipper, you are responsible for shipping the Delivery in the condition it was in when you arrived. You acknowledge and agree that, as a Shipper, you are responsible for your own acts and omissions and are also responsible for the acts and omissions of any individuals whom you invite to, or otherwise provide access to, the contents of the Delivery. In the event that a Requester claims otherwise and provides evidence of damage, including but not limited to photographs, you agree to pay the cost of replacing the damaged items with equivalent items. After being notified of the claim and given forty eight (48) hours to respond, the payment will be charged to and taken from the credit card on file in your Questr Account. Questr also reserves the right to charge the credit card on file in your Questr Account, or otherwise collect payment from you and pursue any avenues available to Questr in this regard, including using Security Deposits, in situations in which you have been determined, in Questr’s sole discretion, to have damaged any content of the Delivery, including, but not limited to, causing damages to the content of the Delivery. If we are unable to charge the credit card on file or otherwise collect payment from you, you agree to remit payment for any damage to the contents of the Delivery to the applicable Requester or to Questr (if applicable).</p>
		<p>Both Shippers and Requesters agree to cooperate with and assist Questr in good faith, and to provide Questr with such information and take such actions as may be reasonably requested by Questr, in connection with any complaints or claims made by Members relating to Deliveries or any personal or other property as the contents of a Delivery or with respect to any investigation undertaken by Questr or a representative of Questr regarding use or abuse of the Site, Application or the Services. If you are a Shipper, upon Questr’s reasonable request, and to the extent you are reasonably able to do so, you agree to participate in mediation or similar resolution process with a Requester, at no cost to you, which process will be conducted by Questr or a third party selected by Questr, with respect to losses for which the Requester is requesting payment from Questr under the Questr Requester Guarantee.</p>
		<p>If you are a Shipper, you understand and agree that Questr reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to make a claim under your insurance policy related to any damage or loss that you may have caused or been responsible for or to a Delivery or any personal or other property within a Delivery. You agree to cooperate with and assist Questr in good faith, and to provide Questr with such information as may be reasonably requested by Questr, in order to make a claim under your insurance policy, including, but not limited to, executing documents and taking such further acts as Questr may reasonably request to assist Questr in accomplishing the foregoing.</p>

		<b>Questr Referral Program</b>
		<p>As a Member, by referring your friends to request a Delivery or apply for a Delivery that receives a confirmed Delivery via the Site, Application and Services, you may participate in the “<b>Referral Program</b>”, which is a loyalty program we offer to our Members. If you choose to participate in the Referral Program, for each friend you refer to Questr for which a Qualifying Referral (defined below) is completed, you may be able to receive Questr Delivery Credits (defined below) (each a “<b>Referral Reward</b>”). “<b>Questr Delivery Credits</b>” are “points” issued by Questr that may be applied as credits toward future confirmed bookings made by Members via the Site, Application and Services.</p>
		<p>In order to receive a Referral Reward, each of the following requirements must be met (collectively, a “<b>Qualifying Referral</b>”): (i) you must log in to your Questr Account on the Site or Application and select either the “Invite Friends” or “Email Your Friends” link; (ii) you must share the link provided with friends via Facebook or Twitter, by copying and pasting the unique referral link generated via the Services, by sending the unique referral link generated via the Services in an email via the Services to your friends, or by using the other tools provided by Questr to share the unique referral link with friends; (iii) a friend who clicks the link on Facebook or otherwise or clicks the link contained in the email must create a Questr Account and become a Member; and (iv) after becoming a Member, the friend must either request a Delivery which is confirmed by the applicable Shipper or apply for a Delivery which subsequently receives a confirmed Delivery via the Services with a Total Value (including Service Fees) of at least six Canadian dollars (CS$6) (or its equivalent in your local currency if we support it) that is not subsequently cancelled. Please note that you may not be the Requester or the Shipper for the booking to receive a Referral Reward.</p>
		<p>It is a condition of the Referral Program that you will circulate or share the unique referral link only to your personal friends. You agree not to publish or distribute the link, or cause the link to be published or distributed, on or via methods, platforms and media where you have no reasonable basis for believing that all or most of the readers or recipients are your personal friends. All Questr Account creations and confirmed booking requests resulting from a breach of the above will be disregarded for determining eligibility for Qualifying Referral and are not eligible for Referral Rewards.</p>
		<p>Satisfaction of a Qualifying Referral and the Referral Reward you receive will be reflected in your Questr Account in a commercially reasonable amount of time after the Qualifying Referral has been completed. The Referral Rewards you accrue will be displayed in your Questr Account profile page. Referral Rewards can be accrued solely by you and you may not earn Referral Rewards by permitting another individual to use your Questr Account. Referral Rewards accrued in multiple Questr Accounts may not be combined into one Questr Account. You may not earn Referral Rewards by creating multiple Questr Accounts. By acquiring Referral Rewards, you agree and acknowledge that Questr is granting you a limited, revocable license to a digital item, and that Referral Rewards are not your personal property. You may not obtain any cash or money in exchange for Referral Rewards. Except as explicitly provided herein, Referral Rewards are non-transferable. Members are responsible for keeping track of the Referral Rewards in their Questr Accounts.</p>
		<p>Questr may suspend or terminate the Referral Program or your participation in the Referral Program at any time for any reason. Questr will not grant any further Referral Rewards after the suspension or termination of the Referral Program or your participation in it, but any Referral Rewards already awarded or received will not be affected by the suspension or termination.</p>
		<b>Specific Terms Regarding Questr Delivery Credits</b>
		<p>Questr Delivery Credits may only be redeemed for confirmed bookings via the Site, Application and Services and after you accrue Questr Delivery Credits, such Questr Delivery Credits will be automatically applied to your next confirmed booking made via the Site, Application and Services. Questr Delivery Credits are credit only and have no cash value nor can they be refunded or exchanged for cash. You may only redeem Questr Delivery Credits after the Questr Delivery Credits are reflected in your Questr Account. The scope, variety, and type of services and products that you may obtain by redeeming Questr Delivery Credits can change at any time.</p>
		<p>Questr Delivery Credits expire three (3) years from the date that any Questr Delivery Credits are last accrued in your Questr Account. Questr may or may not notify you at the email address you provided during Account registration within thirty (30) days of when the Questr Delivery Credits in your Questr Account are scheduled to expire. If for some reason you believe that there is a discrepancy regarding your balance of Questr Delivery Credits, please contact us at <a href="mailto:hello@questr.co">hello@questr.co</a>.

Where applicable, Questr may be required to account for taxes on any services for which the Questr Delivery Credits are redeemed.</p>
		<p>Without limiting any other terms of these Terms and subject to applicable law, all Questr Delivery Credits are forfeited if your Questr Account is terminated or suspended for any reason, in Questr’s sole discretion, or if Questr discontinues providing the Site, Application, Services or the Referral Program.</p>

		<b>Controlling Law and Jurisdiction</b>
		<p>These Terms will be interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of California and the United States of America, without regard to its conflict-of-law provisions. You and we agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of a state court located in San Francisco County, San Francisco, California or a United States District Court, Northern District of California located in San Francisco, California for any actions for which the parties <b>retain the right to seek</b> injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights, <b>as set forth in the Dispute Resolution provision below</b>.</p>
		<b>Dispute Resolution</b>
		<p>You and Questr agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, or to the use of the Services or use of the Site or Application (collectively, “<b>Disputes</b>”) will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights. You acknowledge and agree that you and Questr are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and Questr otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this “Dispute Resolution” section will be deemed void. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this “Dispute Resolution” section will survive any termination of these Terms.</p>
		<p><u>Arbitration Rules and Governing Law</u>. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“<b>AAA</b>”) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the “<b>AAA Rules</b>”) then in effect, except as modified by this “Dispute Resolution” section. (The AAA Rules are available at <a href="http://www.adr.org/arb_med">http://www.adr.org/arb_med</a> or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this section.</p>
		<p><u>Arbitration Process</u>. A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at <a href="http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_004175">http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_004175</a> and a separate form for California residents at <a href="http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_004314">http://adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_004314</a>.) The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of California and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of consumer dispute arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.</p>
		<p><u>Arbitration Location and Procedure</u>. Unless you and Questr otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and Questr submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.</p>
		<p><u>Arbitrator’s Decision</u>. The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator’s award damages must be consistent with the terms of the “Limitation of Liability” section above as to the types and the amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favour of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. Questr will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys’ fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.</p>
		<p><u>Fees</u>. Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules. However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $25,000, Questr will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).</p>
		<p><u>Changes</u>. Notwithstanding the provisions of the “Modification” section above, if Questr changes this “Dispute Resolution” section after the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email to <a href="mailto:hello@questr.co">hello@questr.co</a>) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the “Last Updated Date” above or in the date of Questr’s email to you notifying you of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and Questr in accordance with the provisions of this “Dispute Resolution” section as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).</p>
		<b>General</b>
		<p>The failure of Questr to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Questr. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise. If for any reason an arbitrator or a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.</p>
