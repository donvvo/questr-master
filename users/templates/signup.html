As part of the functionality of the Site, Application and Services, you may link your Questr Account with Third-Party Accounts, by either: (i) providing your Third-Party Account login information to Questr through the Site, Services or Application; or (ii) allowing Questr to access your Third-Party Account, as permitted under the applicable terms and conditions that govern your use of each Third-Party Account.

By granting Questr access to any Third-Party Accounts, you understand that Questr will access, make available and store (if applicable) any Content that you have provided to and stored in your Third-Party Account (“<b>SNS Content</b>”) so that it is available on and through the Site, Services and Application via your Questr Account and Questr Account profile page. Unless otherwise specified in these Terms, all SNS Content, if any, will be considered to be Member Content for all purposes of these Terms. Depending on the Third-Party Accounts you choose and subject to the privacy settings that you have set in such Third-Party Accounts, personally identifiable information that you post to your Third-Party Accounts will be available on and through your Questr Account on the Site, Services and Application. Please note that if a Third-Party Account or associated service becomes unavailable or Questr’s access to such Third-Party Account is terminated by the third-party service provider, then SNS Content will no longer be available on and through the Site, Services and Application. You have the ability to disable the connection between your Questr Account and your Third-Party Accounts, at any time, by accessing the “Settings” section of the Site and Application. PLEASE NOTE THAT YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR THIRD-PARTY ACCOUNTS IS GOVERNED SOLELY BY YOUR AGREEMENT(S) WITH SUCH THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS.

		<p>We will create your Questr Account and your Questr Account profile page for your use of the Site and Application based upon the personal information you provide to us or that we obtain via an SNS as described above. You may not have more than one (1) active Questr Account. You agree to provide accurate, current and complete information during the registration process and to update such information to keep it accurate, current and complete. Questr reserves the right to suspend or terminate your Questr Account and your access to the Site, Application and Services if you create more than one (1) Questr Account or if any information provided during the registration process or thereafter proves to be inaccurate, not current or incomplete. You are responsible for safeguarding your password. You agree that you will not disclose your password to any third party and that you will take sole responsibility for any activities or actions under your Questr Account, whether or not you have authorized such activities or actions. You will immediately notify Questr of any unauthorized use of your Questr Account.</p>
		<b>Delivery Requests</b>
		<p>As a Member, you may create Requests. To apply for a Request, you will be asked a variety of questions about the Delivery to be requested, including, but not limited to, the size, appearance, addresses of pick-up and drop-off locations, and title of the Delivery and then the Site, Application and Services will provide you with a price that is determined by certain attributes including, but not limited to, current local time of where the request was submitted. Requests will be made exclusively available to the Shippers and the Site, Application and Services via the Site, Application and Services. Shippers will be able to apply for your Delivery via the Site, Application and Services based upon the information provided in your Request. You understand and agree that once a Shipper requests an acceptance of your Delivery, you may not request the Shipper to pay a higher price than in the request.</p>
		<p>You acknowledge and agree that you are responsible for any and all Requests you post. Accordingly, you represent and warrant that any Request you post and the shipping of, or a Shipper's application for, a Delivery in a Request you post (i) will not breach any agreements you have entered into with any third parties, and (ii) will (a) be in compliance with all applicable laws (such as laws governing possession of illegally goods, and laws governing shipments of potentially hazardous goods), Tax requirements, and rules and regulations that may apply to any Delivery included in a Request you post (including having all required permits, licenses and registrations), and (b) not conflict with the rights of third parties. Please note that Questr assumes no responsibility for a Requester’s compliance with any agreements with or duties to third parties, applicable laws, rules and regulations. Questr reserves the right, at any time and without prior notice, to permanently terminate a Requester’s Account, to put such Requester on blacklist, and to remove or disable access to any Request for any reason, including Requests that Questr, in its sole discretion, considers to be objectionable for any reason, in violation of these Terms or Questr’s then-current Policies and Community Guidelines (at <a href="http://www.questr.co/help/policies">http://www.questr.co/help/policies</a>), or otherwise harmful to the Site, Application or Services.</p>
		<p>If you are a Requester, you understand and agree that Questr does not act as an insurer or as your contracting agent. If a Shipper requests an acceptance of your Delivery and ships your Delivery, any agreement you enter into with such Shipper is between you and the Shipper and Questr is not a party thereto.</p>
		<p>When you apply for a Request, you may also choose to include certain requirements which must be met by the Members who are eligible to request an acceptance of your Delivery, including, but not limited to, requiring Members to have a profile picture or verified phone number, in order to request your Delivery. Any Member wishing to request Deliveries included in Requests with such requirements must meet these requirements.</p>
		<b>No Endorsement</b>
		<p>Questr does not endorse any Member or any Delivery. Any references in the Site, Application or Services to a Member being “verified” or “connected” (or similar language) only indicate that the Member has completed a relevant verification process, and does not represent anything else. Any such description is not an endorsement, certification or guarantee by Questr about any Member, including of the Member’s identity and whether the Member is trustworthy, safe or suitable. Instead, any such description is intended to be useful information for you to evaluate when you make your own decisions about the identity and suitability of others whom you contact or interact with via the Site, Application and Services. We therefore recommend that you always exercise due diligence and care when deciding whether to ship your Delivery with a Requester or to accept an acceptance request from a Shipper, or to have any other interaction with any other Member. We are not responsible for any damage or harm resulting from your interactions with other Members.</p>
		<p>By using the Site, Application or Services, you agree that any legal remedy or liability that you seek to obtain for actions or omissions of other Members or other third parties will be limited to a claim against the particular Members or other third parties who caused you harm. You agree not to attempt to impose liability on or seek any legal remedy from Questr with respect to such actions or omissions. Accordingly, we encourage you to communicate directly with other Members on the Site and Services regarding any Deliveries or Requests made by you. This limitation shall not apply to any claim by a Requester against Questr regarding the remittance of payments received from a Shipper by Questr on behalf of a Requester, which instead shall be subject to the limitations described in the section below entitled “Limitation of Liability”.</p>
		<b>Bookings and Financial Terms</b>
		<br><i>Key definitions</i>
		<p>
			“<b>Delivery Fees</b>” means the amounts that are due and payable by a Shipper in exchange for that Shipper’s shipment of a Delivery. A pricing model that was developed by Questr, and not Questr, determines these amounts automatically. 
			<br>
			 “<b>Service Fees</b>” means the fee that Questr charges a Shipper for the use of its online platform, which is calculated as a percentage of the applicable Delivery Fees or a fixed amount if the Delivery Fee is under a certain amount. The Service Fees will be displayed to the Shipper when the Shipper is asked whether to send an acceptance request to a Requester.  
			<br>
			“<b>Total Fees</b>” means collectively the Delivery Fees and the Service Fees (plus any Taxes in respect of Service Fees, such as HST in Ontario, Canada).
		</p>
		<i>Requests, Deliveries, and Financial Terms, Part One</i>
		<p>If you are a Requester and an acceptance is requested for your Delivery via the Site, Application and Services, you will be required to either confirm or reject the acceptance request within the Delivery Request Period, otherwise the acceptance request will be automatically cancelled. When an acceptance is requested via the Site, Application and Services, we will share with you (i) the first and last name of the Shipper who has requested the acceptance, (ii) a link to the Shipper’s Questr Account profile page, so that you can view such information before confirming or rejecting the acceptance request. If you are unable to confirm or decide to reject an acceptance request within the Delivery Request Period, any amounts collected by Questr for the requested Delivery will be refunded to your applicable credit card and any pre-authorization of such credit card will be released. When you confirm an acceptance requested by a Shipper, Questr will send you an email, text message or message via the Application confirming the Delivery, depending on the selections you make via the Site, Application and Services.</p>
		<p>Questr will collect the Total Fees at the time of acceptance confirmation (i.e. when the Requester confirms the acceptance request) and will initiate payment of the Delivery Fees (less any Taxes in respect of the Requester Fees, such as HST in Ontario, Canada) from the Requester when the Shipper picks up the applicable Delivery (except to the extent that a refund is due to the Shipper). The time it takes for the Shipper to receive payouts may depend upon the method for receiving payouts chosen by the Requester. Some methods involve the use of third-party payment processors, who may impose their own additional charges for the use of their services on the Requester, including by deducting their charges from the payout amount.</p>
		<p>If you owe or agree to pay any amount to Questr (whether as a result of your requests or shipments as a Shipper or otherwise), then Questr may (but is not obliged to) withhold the amount owing to Questr from any payout amounts due to you as a Shipper or a Requester, and use the withheld amount to setoff the amount owed by you to Questr. If Questr does so, then your obligation to pay Questr will be extinguished to the extent of the amount withheld by Questr, and Questr will cease to owe to you any obligations (including, but not limited to, any obligation to pay you) with respect to the amount withheld.</p>
		<i>Appointment of Questr as Limited Payment Collection Agent for Requester</i>
		<p>Each Shipper hereby appoints Questr as the Requester’s limited payment collection agent solely for the purpose of accepting the Delivery Fees from Requester.</p>
		<p>Each Shipper agrees that payment made by a Requester through Questr, shall be considered the same as a payment made directly to the Shipper, and the Shipper will make the Delivery successful to the Requester in the agreed-upon manner as if the Shipper has received the Delivery Fees. Each Shipper agrees that Questr may, in accordance with the cancellation policy selected by the Shipper and reflected in the relevant Request, (i) permit the Requester to cancel the Delivery and (ii) refund (via Questr) to the Requester that portion of the Delivery Fees specified in the applicable cancellation policy. Each Requester understands that as Questr accepts payments from Requester as the Shipper limited payment collection agent and that Questr’ obligation to pay the Shipper is subject to and conditional upon successful receipt of the associated payments from Requester. Questr does not guarantee payments to Shipper for amounts that have not been successfully received by Questr from Requester. In accepting appointment as the limited authorized agent of the Shipper, Questr assumes no liability for any acts or omissions of the Shipper.</p>
		<p>Please note that Questr does not currently charge fees for the creation of Requests. However, you as a Requester acknowledge and agree that Questr reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to charge you for and collect fees from you for the creation of Requests. Please note that Questr may or may not provide notice of any Request fee collection via the Site, Application and Services, prior to implementing such a Request fee feature.</p>
		<i>Requests, Deliveries, and Financial Terms, Part Two</i>
		<p>The Shipper, not Questr, are solely responsible for honouring any confirmed Deliveries and delivering any Deliveries reserved through the Site, Application and Services. If you, as a Shipper, choose to enter into a transaction with a Requester for the shipment of a Delivery, you agree and understand that you will be required to enter into an agreement with the Requester and you agree to accept any contents, terms, conditions, rules and restrictions associated with such Delivery imposed by the Requester. You acknowledge and agree that you, and not Questr, will be responsible for performing the obligations of any such agreements, that Questr is not a party to such agreements, and that, with the exception of its payment obligations hereunder, Questr disclaims all liability arising from or related to any such agreements. You acknowledge and agree that, notwithstanding the fact that Questr is not a party to the agreement between you and the Requester, Questr acts as the Shipper’s payment collection agent for the limited purpose of accepting payments to you on behalf of the Requester. Upon the Requester’s payment of the Total Fees to Questr, your payment obligation to the Requester for the Delivery Fees is extinguished, and Questr is responsible for remitting the Delivery Fees (less any Taxes in respect of the Requester Fees, such as HST in Ontario, Canada), in the manner described in these Terms. In the event that Questr does not remit any such amounts as described in these Terms, such Requester will have recourse only against such Questr entity.</p>
		<p>The Total Fees payable will be displayed to a Requester before the Requester submits the Delivery on Questr. As noted above, the Requester is required to either confirm or reject the acceptance request within the Delivery Request Period, otherwise the requested Delivery will be automatically cancelled. If a requested Delivery is cancelled (i.e. not confirmed by the applicable Requester), any amounts collected by Questr will be refunded to such Requester, depending on the selections the Requester makes via the Site and Application, and any pre-authorization of such Shipper’s credit card will be released, if applicable.</p>
		<p>You as a Requester agree to pay Questr for the Total Fees for any Delivery requested in connection with your Questr Account if such requested Deliveries are confirmed by the applicable Shipper. In order to establish an acceptance pending the applicable Shipper’s confirmation of your requested Delivery, you understand and agree that Questr, on behalf of the Shipper, reserve the right, in its sole discretion, to (i) obtain a pre-authorization via your credit card for the Total Fees or (ii) charge your credit card a nominal amount, not to exceed one dollar ($1), or a similar sum in the currency in which you are transacting (e.g. one euro or one British pound), to verify your credit card. Once Questr receives confirmation of your Delivery from the applicable Requester, Questr will collect the Total Fees in accordance with these Terms and the pricing terms set forth in the applicable Request. Please note that Questr cannot control any fees that may be charged to a Requester by his or her bank related to Questr’s collection of the Total Fees, and Questr disclaims all liability in this regard.</p>
		<p>In connection with your requested Delivery, you will be asked to provide customary billing information such as name, billing address and credit card information either to Questr or its third-party payment processor(s). You agree to pay Questr for any confirmed bookings made in connection with your Questr Account in accordance with these Terms by one of the methods described on the Site or Application, e.g. by PayPal or credit card. You hereby authorize the collection of such amounts by charging the credit card provided as part of requesting the booking, either directly by Questr or indirectly, via a third-party online payment processor or by one of the payment methods described on the Site or Application. You also authorize Questr to charge your credit card in the event of damage caused at a Delivery as contemplated under “Damage to Deliveries” below and for Security Deposits, if applicable. If you are directed to Questr’ third-party payment processor(s), you may be subject to terms and conditions governing use of that third party’s service and that third party’s personal information collection practices. Please review such terms and conditions and privacy policy before using the services. Once your confirmed booking transaction is complete you will receive a confirmation email summarizing your confirmed booking.</p>
		<b>Service Fees</b>
		<p>In consideration for the use of Questr’s online marketplace and platform, Questr charges the Service Fees. Where applicable, Taxes (such as HST in Ontario, Canada) may also be charged in respect of the Delivery Fees and Service Fees. Questr deducts the Service Fees from the Delivery Fees before remitting the balance to the Shipper as described in these Terms.</p>
		<p>Balances will be remitted by Questr to Shipper via check, PayPal, direct deposit or other payment methods described on the Site or via the Application, in the Shipper currency of choice, depending upon the selections the Shipper makes via the Site, Application and Services. Amounts may be rounded up or down as described the “Rounding Off” section below.</p>
		<p>Please note that Questr, may impose or deduct foreign currency processing costs on or from any payments or payouts by Questr in currencies other than U.S. dollars. More information on any such costs or deductions will be available via the Site and Application. More information on any such costs or deductions will be available via the Site and Application. More information on Services Fees can be found at <a href="http://www.questr.co/help">www.questr.co/help</a>. Except as otherwise provided herein, Service Fees are non-refundable.</p>
		<b>General Requests, Deliveries, and Financial Terms</b>
		<p><i>Cancellations and Refunds</i></p>
		<p>If, as a Requester, you cancel your requested Delivery before the requested Delivery is confirmed by a Shipper, Questr will cancel any pre-authorization to your credit card and/or refund any nominal amounts charged to your credit card in connection with the requested Delivery within a commercially reasonable time. If, as a Requester, you wish to cancel a confirmed booking made via the Site, Application and Services, either prior to or after the Shipper picking up the contents of the Delivery, the cancellation policy of the Requester contained in the applicable Request will apply to such cancellation. Our ability to refund the Delivery Fees and other amounts charged to you will depend upon the terms of the applicable cancellation policy. Details regarding refunds and cancellation policies are available via the Site and Application. The Service Fee is non-refundable regardless of the cancellation policy.</p>
		<p>If a Shipper cancels a confirmed Delivery made via the Site, Services, and Application, Questr will refund the Total Fees for such Delivery to the applicable Requester within a commercially reasonable time of the cancellation. If the Requester requests an acceptance from one of the alternative Requests and the Shipper associated with such alternative Request confirms the Requester’s requested Delivery, then the Requester agrees to pay Questr the Total Fees relating to the confirmed booking for the Delivery in the alternative Request, in accordance with these Terms. If a Shipper cancelled a confirmed booking and you, as a Requester, have not received an email or other communication from Questr, please contact Questr at <a href="http://www.questr.co/help/contact_us">http://www.questr.co/help/contact_us.</a></p>
		<p>If, as a Shipper, you cancel a confirmed booking, Questr may apply penalties or consequences to you or your Delivery, including (i) publishing an automated review on your Delivery indicating that a Delivery was cancelled, (ii) permanently terminating your account and putting the account and its associated information on blacklist, or (iii) imposing a cancellation fee (to be withheld from your future payouts). You will be notified of the situations in which a cancellation fee applies before you decide to cancel.</p>
		<p>In certain circumstances, Questr may decide, in its sole discretion, that it is necessary or desirable to cancel a confirmed booking made via the Site, Application and Services. Questr may also determine, in its sole discretion, to refund to the Requester part or all of the amounts charged to the Requester in accordance with the Refund Policy at <a href="http://www.questr.co/terms/refund_policy">www.questr.co/terms/refund_policy</a>. You agree that Questr and the relevant Shipper or Requester will not have any liability for such cancellations or refunds.</p>
		<i>Rounding Off</i>
		<p>Questr may, in its sole discretion, round up or round down amounts that are payable from or to Shippers or Requesters to the nearest whole functional base unit in which the currency is denominated (e.g. to the nearest dollar, euro or other supported currency); for example, Questr will round up an amount of $101.50 to $102.00, and $101.49 to $101.00.</p>
		<p>Some currencies are denominated in large numbers. In those cases, Questr may determine the functional base unit in which those currencies are denominated to be 10, 100 or 1,000 of the currency; the corresponding examples for such currencies would be for Questr to round up an amount of 1,045 up to 1,050 and 1,044 down to 1,040, or 35,450 up to 35,500 and 35,449 down to 35,400, or 837,500 up to 838,000 and 837,499 down to 837,000.</p>
		<i>Payment Processing Errors</i>
		<p>We will take steps to rectify any payment processing errors that we become aware of. These steps may include crediting or debiting (as appropriate) the same payment method used for the original payout to or payment by you, so that you end up receiving or paying the correct amount.   Donations</p>
		<p>Some Shippers may pledge to donate a portion of the funds they receive from confirmed bookings made via the Site, Application and Services to a particular cause or charity. We do not take any responsibility or liability for whether the Shippers does in fact make the donation he or she pledged to make. In such cases, the Shippers in question is responsible for his or her own compliance with all laws and regulations applicable to such pledges and/or fund-raising.</p>
		<i>Taxes</i>
		<p>Tax regulations may require us to collect appropriate tax information from our Shippers or Requesters, or to withhold taxes from payouts to Shippers or Requesters, or both. You as a Shipper or Requester are solely responsible for keeping the information in your tax forms current, complete and accurate. If you as a Shipper or Requester fail to provide us with documentation that we determine to be sufficient to alleviate our obligation (if any) to withhold payments to you, we reserve the right in our sole discretion to freeze all payouts to you until resolution, to withhold such amounts as required by law, or to do both.</p>
		<p>You as a Shipper or Requester understand and agree that you are solely responsible for determining (i) your applicable Tax reporting requirements, and (ii) the Taxes that should be included, and for including Taxes to be collected or obligations relating to applicable Taxes in Requests and Deliveries. You are also solely responsible for remitting to the relevant authority any Taxes included or received by you. Questr cannot and does not offer Tax-related advice to any Members.</p>
		<p>Where applicable, or based upon request from a Shipper or Requester, Questr may issue a valid VAT invoice to such Shipper or Requester.</p>
		<p>You understand and acknowledge that appropriate governmental agencies, departments or authorities (the “<b>Tax Authority</b>”) where your shipments are done may require Taxes to be collected by Shippers from Requesters on the amount paid for the Deliveries, and to be remitted to the respective Tax Authority.</p>
		<p>Whether you are a Shipper of Requester, you agree that any claim or cause of action relating to collection and remittance of Taxes shall not extend to any supplier or vendor that may be used by Questr in connection with collection and remittance of any taxes, if any. Shippers and Requesters agree that we may seek additional amounts from you in the event that the Taxes collected or remitted are insufficient to fully discharge your obligations to the Tax Authority, and agree that your sole remedy for any taxes collected is a refund of any taxes collected by Questr from the applicable Tax Authority in accordance with applicable procedures set by that Tax Authority.</p>
		<i>Damage to the Contents of Deliveries</i>
		<p>As a Shipper, you are responsible for shipping the Delivery in the condition it was in when you arrived. You acknowledge and agree that, as a Shipper, you are responsible for your own acts and omissions and are also responsible for the acts and omissions of any individuals whom you invite to, or otherwise provide access to, the contents of the Delivery. In the event that a Requester claims otherwise and provides evidence of damage, including but not limited to photographs, you agree to pay the cost of replacing the damaged items with equivalent items. After being notified of the claim and given forty eight (48) hours to respond, the payment will be charged to and taken from the credit card on file in your Questr Account. Questr also reserves the right to charge the credit card on file in your Questr Account, or otherwise collect payment from you and pursue any avenues available to Questr in this regard, including using Security Deposits, in situations in which you have been determined, in Questr’s sole discretion, to have damaged any content of the Delivery, including, but not limited to, causing damages to the content of the Delivery. If we are unable to charge the credit card on file or otherwise collect payment from you, you agree to remit payment for any damage to the contents of the Delivery to the applicable Requester or to Questr (if applicable).</p>
		<p>Both Shippers and Requesters agree to cooperate with and assist Questr in good faith, and to provide Questr with such information and take such actions as may be reasonably requested by Questr, in connection with any complaints or claims made by Members relating to Deliveries or any personal or other property as the contents of a Delivery or with respect to any investigation undertaken by Questr or a representative of Questr regarding use or abuse of the Site, Application or the Services. If you are a Shipper, upon Questr’s reasonable request, and to the extent you are reasonably able to do so, you agree to participate in mediation or similar resolution process with a Requester, at no cost to you, which process will be conducted by Questr or a third party selected by Questr, with respect to losses for which the Requester is requesting payment from Questr under the Questr Requester Guarantee.</p>
		<p>If you are a Shipper, you understand and agree that Questr reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to make a claim under your insurance policy related to any damage or loss that you may have caused or been responsible for or to a Delivery or any personal or other property within a Delivery. You agree to cooperate with and assist Questr in good faith, and to provide Questr with such information as may be reasonably requested by Questr, in order to make a claim under your insurance policy, including, but not limited to, executing documents and taking such further acts as Questr may reasonably request to assist Questr in accomplishing the foregoing.</p>

		<p>In order to receive a Referral Reward, each of the following requirements must be met (collectively, a “<b>Qualifying Referral</b>”): (i) you must log in to your Questr Account on the Site or Application and select either the “Invite Friends” or “Email Your Friends” link; (ii) you must share the link provided with friends via Facebook or Twitter, by copying and pasting the unique referral link generated via the Services, by sending the unique referral link generated via the Services in an email via the Services to your friends, or by using the other tools provided by Questr to share the unique referral link with friends; (iii) a friend who clicks the link on Facebook or otherwise or clicks the link contained in the email must create a Questr Account and become a Member; and (iv) after becoming a Member, the friend must either request a Delivery which is confirmed by the applicable Shipper or apply for a Delivery which subsequently receives a confirmed Delivery via the Services with a Total Value (including Service Fees) of at least six Canadian dollars (CS$6) (or its equivalent in your local currency if we support it) that is not subsequently cancelled. Please note that you may not be the Requester or the Shipper for the booking to receive a Referral Reward.</p>
		<p>It is a condition of the Referral Program that you will circulate or share the unique referral link only to your personal friends. You agree not to publish or distribute the link, or cause the link to be published or distributed, on or via methods, platforms and media where you have no reasonable basis for believing that all or most of the readers or recipients are your personal friends. All Questr Account creations and confirmed booking requests resulting from a breach of the above will be disregarded for determining eligibility for Qualifying Referral and are not eligible for Referral Rewards.</p>
		<p>Satisfaction of a Qualifying Referral and the Referral Reward you receive will be reflected in your Questr Account in a commercially reasonable amount of time after the Qualifying Referral has been completed. The Referral Rewards you accrue will be displayed in your Questr Account profile page. Referral Rewards can be accrued solely by you and you may not earn Referral Rewards by permitting another individual to use your Questr Account. Referral Rewards accrued in multiple Questr Accounts may not be combined into one Questr Account. You may not earn Referral Rewards by creating multiple Questr Accounts. By acquiring Referral Rewards, you agree and acknowledge that Questr is granting you a limited, revocable license to a digital item, and that Referral Rewards are not your personal property. You may not obtain any cash or money in exchange for Referral Rewards. Except as explicitly provided herein, Referral Rewards are non-transferable. Members are responsible for keeping track of the Referral Rewards in their Questr Accounts.</p>
		<p>Questr may suspend or terminate the Referral Program or your participation in the Referral Program at any time for any reason. Questr will not grant any further Referral Rewards after the suspension or termination of the Referral Program or your participation in it, but any Referral Rewards already awarded or received will not be affected by the suspension or termination.</p>
		<b>Specific Terms Regarding Questr Delivery Credits</b>
		<p>Questr Delivery Credits may only be redeemed for confirmed bookings via the Site, Application and Services and after you accrue Questr Delivery Credits, such Questr Delivery Credits will be automatically applied to your next confirmed booking made via the Site, Application and Services. Questr Delivery Credits are credit only and have no cash value nor can they be refunded or exchanged for cash. You may only redeem Questr Delivery Credits after the Questr Delivery Credits are reflected in your Questr Account. The scope, variety, and type of services and products that you may obtain by redeeming Questr Delivery Credits can change at any time.</p>
		<p>Questr Delivery Credits expire three (3) years from the date that any Questr Delivery Credits are last accrued in your Questr Account. Questr may or may not notify you at the email address you provided during Account registration within thirty (30) days of when the Questr Delivery Credits in your Questr Account are scheduled to expire. If for some reason you believe that there is a discrepancy regarding your balance of Questr Delivery Credits, please contact us at <a href="mailto:hello@questr.co">hello@questr.co</a>.

Where applicable, Questr may be required to account for taxes on any services for which the Questr Delivery Credits are redeemed.</p>
		<p>Without limiting any other terms of these Terms and subject to applicable law, all Questr Delivery Credits are forfeited if your Questr Account is terminated or suspended for any reason, in Questr’s sole discretion, or if Questr discontinues providing the Site, Application, Services or the Referral Program.</p>

		<b>Assignment</b>
		<p>You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without Questr’s prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be null and of no effect. Questr may assign or transfer these Terms, at its sole discretion, without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.</p>
		<b>Notices</b>
		<p>Any notices or other communications permitted or required hereunder, including those regarding modifications to these Terms, will be in writing and given by Questr (i) via email (in each case to the address that you provide) or (ii) by posting to the Site or via the Application. For notices made by e-mail, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.</p>
		<b>Controlling Law and Jurisdiction</b>
		<p>These Terms will be interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of California and the United States of America, without regard to its conflict-of-law provisions. You and we agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of a state court located in San Francisco County, San Francisco, California or a United States District Court, Northern District of California located in San Francisco, California for any actions for which the parties <b>retain the right to seek</b> injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights, <b>as set forth in the Dispute Resolution provision below</b>.</p>
		<b>Dispute Resolution</b>
		<p>You and Questr agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, or to the use of the Services or use of the Site or Application (collectively, “<b>Disputes</b>”) will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights. You acknowledge and agree that you and Questr are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and Questr otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this “Dispute Resolution” section will be deemed void. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this “Dispute Resolution” section will survive any termination of these Terms.</p>
		<p><u>Arbitration Rules and Governing Law</u>. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“<b>AAA</b>”) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the “<b>AAA Rules</b>”) then in effect, except as modified by this “Dispute Resolution” section. (The AAA Rules are available at <a href="http://www.adr.org/arb_med">http://www.adr.org/arb_med</a> or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this section.</p>
		<p><u>Arbitration Process</u>. A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at <a href="http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_004175">http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_004175</a> and a separate form for California residents at <a href="http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_004314">http://adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_004314</a>.) The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of California and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of consumer dispute arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.</p>
		<p><u>Arbitration Location and Procedure</u>. Unless you and Questr otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and Questr submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.</p>
		<p><u>Arbitrator’s Decision</u>. The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator’s award damages must be consistent with the terms of the “Limitation of Liability” section above as to the types and the amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favour of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. Questr will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys’ fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.</p>
		<p><u>Fees</u>. Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules. However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $25,000, Questr will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).</p>
		<p><u>Changes</u>. Notwithstanding the provisions of the “Modification” section above, if Questr changes this “Dispute Resolution” section after the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email to <a href="mailto:hello@questr.co">hello@questr.co</a>) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the “Last Updated Date” above or in the date of Questr’s email to you notifying you of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and Questr in accordance with the provisions of this “Dispute Resolution” section as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).</p>
		<b>General</b>
		<p>The failure of Questr to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Questr. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise. If for any reason an arbitrator or a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.</p>
		<b>Contacting Questr</b>
		<p>If you have any questions about these Terms or any App Store Sourced Application, please contact Questr at <a href="mailto:hello@questr.co">hello@questr.co</a>.

			<h2>WHAT TYPES OF INFORMATION DOES QUESTR GATHER ABOUT ITS USERS?</h2>

				<li>link your account on a third party site (e.g. Facebook) to your Questr account, in which case we will obtain the Personal Information that you have provided to the third party site, to the extent allowed by your settings with the third party site and authorized by you; and</li>

				<li>communicate with Questr.</li>
			</p>

			<p><b>2. Mobile Data</b></p>

			<p>When you use certain features of the Platform, in particular our mobile applications we may receive, store and process different types of information about your location, including general information (e.g., IP address, zip code) and more specific information (e.g., GPS-based functionality on mobile devices used to access the Platform or specific features of the platform). If you access the Platform through a mobile device and you do not want your device to provide us with location-tracking information, you can disable the GPS or other location-tracking functions on your device, provided your device allows you to do this. See your device manufacturer’s instructions for further details.</p>

			<p><b>3. Log Data</b></p>

			<p>We may also receive, store and process Log Data, which is information that is automatically recorded by our servers whenever you access or use the Platform, regardless of whether you are registered with Questr or logged in to your Questr account, such as your IP Address, the date and time you access or use the Platform, the hardware and software you are using, referring and exit pages and URLs, the number of clicks, pages viewed and the order of those pages, and the amount of time spent on particular pages.</p>

			<p><b>4. Cookies, and other Tracking Technologies</b></p>

			<p>Questr uses cookies and other similar technologies on the Platform. We may also allow our business partners to use their cookies and other tracking technologies on the Platform. As a result, when you access or use the Platform, you will provide or make available certain information to us and to our business partners.</p>

			<p>While you may disable the usage of cookies through your browser settings, we do not change our practices in response to a “Do Not Track” signal in the HTTP header from your browser or mobile application. We track your activities if you click on advertisements for Questr services on third party platforms such as search engines and social networks, and may use analytics to track what you do in response to those advertisements.</p>

			<p>We may, either directly or through third party companies and individuals we engage to provide services to us, also continue to track your behavior on our own Platform for purposes of our own customer support, analytics, research, product development, fraud prevention, risk assessment, regulatory compliance, investigation, as well as to enable you to use and access the Platform and pay for your activities on the Platform. We may also, either directly or through third party companies and individuals we engage to provide services to us, track your behavior on our own Platform to market and advertise our services to you on the Platform and third party websites. Third parties that use cookies and other tracking technologies to deliver targeted advertisements on our Platform and/or third party websites may offer you a way to prevent such targeted advertisements by opting-out at the websites of industry groups such as the Network Advertising Initiative (http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/) and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance (http://www.aboutads.info/choices/). You may also be able to control advertising cookies provided by publishers, for example Google’s Ad Preference Manager (https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/). Please note that even if you choose to opt-out of receiving targeted advertising, you may still receive advertising on the Platform – it just will not be tailored to your interests.</p>

			<p>Third parties may not collect information about users’ online activities on the Platform except as described in this policy and our Cookie Policy.</p>

			<p><b>5. Third-party social plugins</b></p>

			<p>Our Platform may use social plugins which are provided and operated by third-party companies, such as Facebook’s Like Button.</p>

			<p>As a result of this, you may send to the third-party company the information that you are viewing on a certain part of our Platform. If you are not logged into your account with the third-party company, then the third party may not know your identity. If you are logged into your account with the third-party company, then the third party may be able to link information about your visit to our Platform to your account with them. Similarly, your interactions with the social plugin may be recorded by the third party.</p>

			<p>Please refer to the third party’s privacy policy to find out more about its data practices, such as what data is collected about you and how the third party uses such data.</p>

			<h2>HOW QUESTR USES AND PROCESSES THE INFORMATION THAT YOU PROVIDE OR MAKE AVAILABLE</h2>

			<p>
				We use and process Information about you for the following general purposes: 

				<ul>
					<li>to enable you to access and use the Platform;</li>

					<li>to operate, protect, improve and optimize the Platform, Questr’s business, and our users’ experience, such as to perform analytics, conduct research, and for advertising and marketing;</li>

					<li>to help create and maintain a trusted and safer environment on the Platform, such as fraud detection and prevention, conducting investigations and risk assessments, verifying the address of your listings, verifying any identifications provided by you, and conducting checks against databases such as public government databases;</li>

					<li>to send you service, support and administrative messages, reminders, technical notices, updates, security alerts, and information requested by you;</li>

					<li>where we have your consent, to send you marketing and promotional messages and other information that may be of interest to you, including information sent on behalf of our business partners that we think you may find interesting. You will be able to unsubscribe or opt-out from receiving these communications in your settings (in the “Account” section) when you login to your Questr account;</li>

					<li>to administer rewards, surveys, sweepstakes, contests, or other promotional activities or events sponsored or managed by Questr or our business partners; and</li>

					<li>to comply with our legal obligations, resolve any disputes that we may have with any of our users, and enforce our agreements with third parties.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<h2>HOW QUESTR USES AND PROCESSES USER COMMUNICATIONS</h2>

			<p>We may review, scan, or analyze your communications with other users exchanged via the Platform for fraud prevention, risk assessment, regulatory compliance, investigation, product development, research and customer support purposes. For example, as part of our fraud prevention efforts, the Platform may scan and analyze messages to mask contact information and references to other websites. This helps to prevent fraudulent actors from asking Guests to send them money outside of the Platform, such as by bank transfer or other money transfer methods. We may also scan, review or analyze messages for research and product development purposes to help make search, booking and user communications more efficient and effective, as well as to debug product offerings. </p>

			<p>We will not review, scan, or analyze your communications for sending third party marketing messages to you. We will also not sell these reviews or analyses of communications to third parties. We will also use automated methods to carry out these reviews or analyses where reasonably possible. However, from time to time we may have to manually review some communications. By using the Platform, you consent that Questr, in its sole discretion, may review, scan, analyze, and store your communications, whether done manually or through automated means.</p>

			<h2>WHEN QUESTR DISCLOSES OR SHARES PERSONAL INFORMATION, AND TO WHOM</h2>

			<b>IMPORTANT: When you use the Platform, your data may be sent to the United States and possibly other countries</b>

			<p>We may transfer, store, use and process your information, including any Personal Information, to countries outside of the European Economic Area ("<b>EEA</b>") including the United States. Please note that laws vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and so the privacy laws applicable to the places where your information is transferred to or stored, used or processed in, may be different from the privacy laws applicable to the place where you are resident.</p>

			<p>If you are located in the EEA or in Switzerland, please also see our Safe Harbor Notice (http://www.questr.co/terms/safe_harbor_notice).</p>

			<p>
				Your Personal Information may be disclosed as follows: 

				<ul>
					<li>Parts of your public profile page that contain some Personal Information may be displayed in other parts of the Platform to other users for marketing purposes.</li>

					<li>Your public Listing page will always include some minimum information such as the city and neighborhood where the Accommodation is located, your public profile photo and your responsiveness in replying to Guests’ queries. Parts of your public Listing page may be displayed in other parts of the Platform to other users for marketing purposes. The Platform may also display the Accommodation’s approximate geographic location on a map, such that a user can see the general area of the Accommodation.</li>

					<li>The Platform allows your public profile and public Listing pages to be included in search engines, in which case your public profile and public Listing pages will be indexed by search engines and may be published as search results. This option is enabled by default, and you may opt out of this feature by changing your settings on the Platform. If you change your settings or the information on your public profile or public Listing pages, third-party search engines may not update their databases quickly or at all. We do not control the practices of third-party search engines, and they may use caches containing outdated information, including any information indexed by the search engine before you change your settings or the information on your public profile or public Listing pages.</li>

					<li>When you submit a request to book an Accommodation, your full name will become visible to the Host. In addition, if you agree to be contacted by the Host by phone when submitting your request and the Host decides to do so, Questr will call your phone number first, before connecting you with the Host. We will not share your phone number unless there is a confirmed booking.</li>

					<li>When your request to book an Accommodation is accepted by the Host or when you accept a Guest’s request to book your Accommodation, we will disclose some of your Personal Information to the Host or Guest. However, your billing information will never be shared with another user.</li>

					<li>When a Guest stays at your Accommodation or when you stay at a Host’s Accommodation, we will ask you to review the Guest or the Accommodation. If you choose to provide a review, your review may be public on the Platform.</li>

					<li>You may link your account on a third party social networking site to your Questr account. We refer to a person’s contacts on these third party sites as “Friends”. When you create this linkage: 
						<ul>
							<li>some of the information you provide to us from the linking of your accounts may be published on your Questr account profile;</li>

							<li>your activities on the Platform may be displayed to your Friends on the Platform and/or that third party site;</li>

							<li>other Questr users may be able to see any common Friends that you may have with them, or that you are a Friend of their Friend if applicable;</li>

							<li>other Questr users may be able to see any schools, hometowns or other groups you have in common with them as listed on your linked social networking site(s); and</li>

							<li>the information you provide to us from the linking of your accounts may be stored, processed and transmitted for fraud prevention and risk assessment purposes.</li>
						</ul>
					The publication and display of information that you provide to Questr through this linkage is subject to your settings and authorizations on the Platform and the third party site.</li>

					<li>We may distribute parts of the Platform (including your Listing) for display on sites operated by Questr’s business partners, using technologies such as HTML widgets. If and when your Listings are displayed on a partner’s site, information from your public profile page may also be displayed.</li>

					<li>We may allow our related entities such as our subsidiaries, and their employees, to use and process your Personal Information in the same way and to the same extent that we are permitted to under this Privacy Policy. These related entities comply with the same obligations that we have to protect your Personal Information under this Privacy Policy.</li>

					<li>We may also engage third party companies and individuals, who may be located outside of the EEA, to provide services to us, including services to help verify your identification or to conduct checks against databases such as public government databases (where legally allowed). We may provide Personal Information about you to these third parties, or give them access to this Personal Information, for the limited purpose of allowing them to provide these services. We will ensure that such third parties have contractual obligations to protect this Personal Information and to not use it for unrelated purposes.</li>

					<li>You acknowledge, consent and agree that Questr may access, preserve and disclose your account information and Collective Content if required to do so by law or in a good faith belief that such access, preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) respond to claims asserted against Questr; (b) to comply with legal process (for example, subpoenas and warrants); (c) to enforce and administer our agreements with users, such as the Terms of Service, (http://www.questr.co/terms) and the Host Guarantee Terms and Conditions (http://www.questr.co/terms/host_guarantee); (d) for fraud prevention, risk assessment, investigation, customer support, product development and de-bugging purposes; or (e) to protect the rights, property or personal safety of Questr, its users or members of the public. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify users about law enforcement requests for their data unless prohibited by law or by the government request, or if doing so would be futile or ineffective.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<p>We may also publish, disclose and use Aggregated Information and non-personal information for industry analysis, demographic profiling, marketing and advertising, and other business purposes.</p>

			<h2>BUSINESS TRANSFERS BY QUESTR</h2>

			<p>If Questr undertakes or is involved in any merger, acquisition, reorganization, sale of assets or bankruptcy or insolvency event, then we may sell, transfer or share some or all of our assets, including your Personal Information. In this event, we will notify you before your Personal Information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>

			<h2>HOW TO CHANGE OR DELETE YOUR INFORMATION, OR CANCEL YOUR QUESTR ACCOUNT</h2>

			<p>You may review, update, correct or delete the Personal Information in your Questr account by logging in to your account. If you would like to cancel your Questr account entirely, you can do so by logging in to your account. Please also note that any reviews, forum postings and similar materials posted by you may continue to be publicly available on the Platform in association with your first name, even after your Questr account is cancelled.</p>

			<h2>KEEPING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION SECURE</h2>

			<p>We have implemented reasonable administrative, technical, and physical security measures to protect your Personal Information against the unauthorized access, destruction or alteration of your information. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, and no method of storing electronic information, can be 100% secure. So, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your transmissions to us and of your Personal Information that we store.</p>

			<h2>YOUR PRIVACY WHEN YOU ACCESS THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES AND RESOURCES</h2>

			<p>The Platform will contain links to other websites not owned or controlled by Questr. Questr does not have any control over third party websites. These other websites may place their own cookies, web beacons or other files on your device, or collect and solicit Personal Information from you. They will have their own rules about the collection, use and disclosure of Personal Information. We encourage you to read the terms of use and privacy policies of the other websites that you visit.</p>

			<p>Some portions of the Platform implement Google Maps/Earth mapping services, including Google Maps API(s). Your use of Google Maps/Earth is subject to Google’s terms of use (located at <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en_us/help/terms_maps.html">http://www.google.com/intl/en_us/help/terms_maps.html</a>) and Google’s privacy policy (located at <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy.html">http://www.google.com/privacy.html</a>), as may be amended by Google from time to time.</p>

			<h2>SPECIAL FEATURES AND PROGRAMS</h2>

			<b>Referral service and requesting for references</b>

			<p>The Platform provides a referral service that allows you to invite your friends and contacts to use the Platform. The Platform also allows you to ask your friends and contacts to write a reference for you, to be published on your Questr profile.</p>

			<p>We may integrate the Platform with third party sites such as Facebook, so that you can send invitation messages or requests for references via the third party site itself. These messages will be sent by the third party site, and Questr does not collect or retain the contact information that is used to send them.</p>

			<p>You may also send invitation/request emails via the Platform itself, in which case we will ask you for the email addresses to send these emails to. You can type in the email addresses manually, or you can request Questr to import the contacts in your email account address book(s). In both cases, we will use the information sent to us for the sole purpose of sending your friends and contacts a one-time email, inviting him or her to visit the Platform or to write a reference for you. With respect to referrals, we will also store the email addresses of your invitees to track if your friend joins Questr in response to your referral.</p>

			<p>If you request us to import your contacts, we will collect, but not store, the username and password for the email account you wish to import your contacts from. We will use this information only for the purpose of importing your contacts.</p>

			<b>Affiliate Program</b>

			<p>If you are allowed to join Questr’s Affiliate Program (see <a href="http://www.questr.co/affiliates">http://www.questr.co/affiliates</a>) and you sign up for it, you will have to provide us with certain Personal Information to enable us to provide the Affiliate Program to you.</p>

			<b>Meetups</b>

			<p>The Platform may allow registered account holders to organize, search for or participate in offline events (“<b>Meetups”</b>) in selected cities.</p>

			<p>If you organize a Meetup or indicate that you will attend one, this information, together with some of your public information (such as your profile picture and public profile page) and any messages that you post about that Meetup, will be visible to users who browse the event. However, Questr will never disclose where you are staying to another user.</p>

			<b>Groups</b>

			<p>The Platform may allow registered account holders to participate in online discussion forums ("<b>Group(s)</b>”) in selected cities.</p>

			<p>If you join a Group, then your membership in the Group as well as some of your public information (such as your profile picture and public profile page) will be visible to users who browse the Group. If you publish postings in a Group, then your postings will be visible to such users as well. The ability to browse the Group will depend on the Group settings, and it may or may not be limited to members of that Group.</p>

			<h2>CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h2>

			<p>We may change how we collect and then use Personal Information at any time and without prior notice, at our sole discretion. </p>

			<p>TWe may change this Privacy Policy at any time. If we make material changes to the Privacy Policy, we will notify you either by posting the changed Privacy Policy on the Platform or by sending an email to you. We will also update the “Last Updated Date” at the top of this Privacy Policy. If we let you know of changes through an email communication, then the date on which we send the email will be deemed to be the date of your receipt of that email.</p>

			<p>It’s important that you review the changed Privacy Policy. If you do not wish to agree to the changed Privacy Policy, then we will not be able to continue providing the Platform to you, and your only option will be to stop accessing the Platform and deactivate your Questr account. You can find out more about how to deactivate your Questr account at <a href="http://www.questr.co/help">http://www.questr.co/help</a>.</p>

			<h2>GOT FEEDBACK?</h2>

			<p>Your opinion matters to us! If you’d like to provide feedback to us about this Privacy Policy, please email us at <a href="mailto:hello@questr.co">hello@questr.co</a>.</p>

			<h2>COOKIE POLICY</h2>

			<p>Questr uses "cookies" in conjunction with the Platform to obtain information. A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your device (e.g., your phone or your computer) for record-keeping purposes. For example, a cookie could allow the Platform to recognize your browser, while another could store your preferences and other information.</p>

			<p>Your browser may allow you to set how it handles cookies, such as declining all cookies or prompting you to decide whether to accept each cookie. But please note that some parts of the Platform may not work as intended or may not work at all without cookies.</p>

			<b>Questr cookies and third party cookies</b>

			<p>Questr may place our cookies on your device via the Platform. Accordingly, our Privacy Policy will apply to our treatment of the information we obtain via our cookies.</p>

			<p>We may also allow our business partners to place cookies on your device. For example, we use Google Analytics for web analytics, and so Google may also set cookies on your device. As further explained below, third parties may also place cookies on your device for advertising purposes.</p>

			<p>There are two types of cookies used on the Platform, namely “<b>persistent cookies</b>” and “<b>session cookies</b>”.

			<p>Session cookies will normally expire when you close your browser, while persistent cookies will remain on your device after you close your browser, and can be used again the next time you access the Platform.</p>

			<b>Other technologies</b>

			<p>The Platform may also use other technologies with similar functionality to cookies, such as web beacons and tracking URLs to obtain Log Data about users. We may also use web beacons and tracking URLs in our messages to you to determine whether you have opened a certain message or accessed a certain link.</p>

			<b>Uses for Questr cookies</b>

			<p>
				Questr uses cookies for a number of purposes, such as the following: 
				<ul>
					<li>to enable, facilitate and streamline the functioning of the Platform across different webpages and browser sessions.</li>
					<li>to simplify your access to and use of the Platform and make it more seamless.</li>
					<li>to monitor and analyze the performance, operation and effectiveness of the Platform, so that we can improve and optimize it.</li>
					<li>to show you content (which may include advertisements) that is more relevant to you.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<b>Uses for third party cookies</b>

			<p>Our partners’ cookies are intended to obtain information to help them provide services to Questr. For example, third party companies and individuals we engage to provide services to us may track your behavior on our Platform to market and advertise Questr listings or services to you on the Platform and third party websites. Third parties that use cookies and other tracking technologies to deliver targeted advertisements on our Platform and/or third party websites may offer you a way to prevent such targeted advertisements by opting-out at the websites of industry groups such as the Network Advertising Initiative (<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/">http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/</a>) and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance (<a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a>). You may also be able to control advertising cookies provided by publishers, for example Google’s Ad Preference Manager (<a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/">https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/</a>). Please note that even if you choose to opt-out of receiving targeted advertising, you may still receive advertising on the Platform – it just will not be tailored to your interests.</p>

			<p>In addition, Facebook places a cookie via the Platform that allows Facebook to obtain aggregated, non-Personal Information to optimize their services. For example, if a user clicks on an advertisement for the Questr mobile app on Facebook and subsequently installs the app, this cookie will inform Facebook that a user (who is not personally identified) has installed the app after clicking on the advertisement. This cookie may also inform Facebook that a user is using the app, without identifying the specific actions taken by the user in the app.</p>

			<b>Disabling Cookies</b>

			<p>Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can modify your browser setting to decline cookies by visiting the Help portion of your browser’s toolbar. If you choose to decline cookies, please note that you may not be able to sign in, customize, or use some of the interactive features of the Platform. Flash cookies operate differently than browser cookies, and cookie management tools available in a web browser will not remove flash cookies. To learn more about how to manage flash cookies, you can visit the Adobe website (<a href="http://www.adobe.com/">http://www.adobe.com/</a>) and make changes at the Global Privacy Settings Panel (<a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager02.html">http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager02.html</a>).</p>

			<b>Changes to this Cookie Policy</b>

			<p>We can change this Cookie Policy at any time. If we make material changes to the Cookie Policy, we will let you know either by posting the changed Cookie Policy on the Platform or by sending you an email.</p>

			<p>It’s important that you review the changed Cookie Policy. If you do not wish to agree to the changed Cookie Policy, then we cannot continue to provide the Platform to you, and your only option is to stop accessing the Platform and deactivate your Questr account. You can find out more about how to deactivate your Questr account at <a href="http://www.questr.co/help">http://www.questr.co/help</a>.</p>
